# ðŸ”¢ Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN (MNIST)

This project demonstrates how to implement a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** in Python using TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**. It achieves high accuracy on a classic image classification problem.
